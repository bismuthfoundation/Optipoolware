miner.py will not work with optipoolware, you need to use the provided optihash.py which has miner.txt for configuration.
optihash.py can be run from a device without bismuth installed providing you have python 3.5 (as per wallet) and connections.py
There are compiled executables for windows and linux
The linux executable was compiled with nuitka on ubuntu 16.04 lts
